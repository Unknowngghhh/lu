# Lu

**Lu** is an evolving pseudocode compiler designed to translate pseudocode into Python code. It aims to facilitate the conversion of algorithmic logic from pseudocode to executable Python code, making the implementation process more efficient and straightforward.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Converts pseudocode into tokens for easier processing.
- **Print Statement Conversion**: Translates pseudocode print statements into Python's `print()` function.
- **Comment Handling**: Identifies and ignores comments in pseudocode.

## Installation

To set up Lu on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gsdev215/lu.git
    ```


## TODO

- [x] Implement basic tokenization
- [x] Handle `print` statements in pseudocode
- [x] Add support for comment handling
- [ ] Improve error handling and reporting
- [ ] Add support for additional pseudocode constructs (e.g., loops, conditionals)
- [ ] Develop an interactive mode for real-time translation
- [ ] Enhance documentation and provide usage examples
